# INTRODUCTION
This program contains a mobile robot connected to a wireless sensor network (WSN) to assist a person in his or her daily work. This program is only used for indoor areas such as house or office space. A large part of the system is a service robot that can follow a path based on a line drawn on the ground. This line system directs the robot to the specific room it needs to go to, once the robot has entered the camera camera is activated to find people inside. The robot is integrated with in-depth learning programs for people to see and to identify the person they are supposed to serve. At the beginning of the task robot you are given the name of the person to be provided. The robot can detect a person based on a stored database and once it has detected a person it will be able to access a person using a compact box detected as a center. Once provided one can release the robot by giving a voice command.
# Features
