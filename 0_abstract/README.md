# ABSTRACT
This paper proposes an Intelligent House Services System (IHSS) that integrate service robots with sensor networks and user monitoring can help  people with their daily activities, allowing them to stay in their homes and live active lives for as long as possible. In this paper, we outline the AAL system currently developed in the European project Robot-Era, and describe the engineering aspects and the service-oriented software architecture of the domestic robot, a service robot with advanced manipulation capabilities. In tests with real end users, the performance and acceptability of the platform are evaluat
